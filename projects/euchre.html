                        <h4>About Project</h4>
                        <p>This project was developed with my friend for our final project of our Object-Oriented Programming
                            course (CS 246) during second year, for which we achieved a grade of <strong>104%</strong>.
                            The game was developed with C++ and we used many different design patterns such as the Model View 
                            Controller design pattern. The game can be played by two players or a player can play against the CPU,
                            for which we implemented an AI algorithm to play the best card in each situation.
